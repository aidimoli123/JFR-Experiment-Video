The results of the experiments for the paper **Control barrier function based robust collision avoidance path following of USVs with reduced conservativenes**s are available in this file. The video illustrates the collision avoidance path following behavior of the main USV, captured by drone aerial photography. It can be seen that the USV successfully performs collision avoidance path following maneuvers.
