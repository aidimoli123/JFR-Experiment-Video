The results of the experiments for the paper *_Control barrier function based robust collision avoidance path following of USVs with reduced conservativeness_* are available in this file. The video illustrates the collision avoidance path following behavior of the main USV, recoreded by drone aerial photography. It can be seen that the USV successfully performs collision avoidance path following maneuvers.
